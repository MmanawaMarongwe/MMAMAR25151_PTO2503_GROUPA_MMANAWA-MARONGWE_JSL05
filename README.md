# JSL05 Project Brief: Task Board with Local Storage Persistence and Task Creation

## üìΩÔ∏è Overview

This project is a Kanban-style task board enhanced with local storage persistence and task creation via a modal.
Users can add new tasks, which are then stored in local storage and displayed immediately in the appropriate columns (‚ÄúTo Do‚Äù, ‚ÄúDoing‚Äù, ‚ÄúDone‚Äù).
Even after refreshing the page or reopening the browser, tasks remain available.

The goal was to practice local storage handling, DOM manipulation, modular JavaScript structure, and JSDoc documentation, while ensuring a clean, responsive design aligned with the Figma brief.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
	‚Ä¢	HTML5 ‚Äì base structure of the board and modal
	‚Ä¢	CSS3 ‚Äì responsive styling for columns, tasks, and modal
	‚Ä¢	JavaScript (ES6 modules) ‚Äì task creation, rendering, local storage persistence, modal interaction
	‚Ä¢	Local Storage ‚Äì saving and retrieving tasks across sessions
	‚Ä¢	JSDoc ‚Äì documenting major functions for maintainability

## Key Objectives

### Persistent Task Storage & Retrieval

- **Save tasks to local storage**: On page load, the application should **load tasks** from local storage so that the latest task list is available, even after a refresh.
- Ensure that **tasks are saved in local storage** every time a new task is added so that tasks persist after the page refreshes.
- **Load tasks** from local storage on startup, so users can see the latest tasks without manually re-entering them.
- Tasks should be categorized correctly into their respective columns (e.g., "To Do", "Doing", "Done") based on their **status** when loaded from local storage.

### Task Creation & Modal Interaction

- Provide an **"Add Task" button** that, when clicked, opens a **modal** for creating a new task.
- The modal should include:
  - Fields for entering the **task title** and **description**.
  - A dropdown to select the task **status** ("To Do", "Doing", "Done").
  - A **submit button** to add the new task to the task board immediately.
- After submitting, the task should appear on the board without requiring a page refresh.

## Design & Responsiveness

- The **"Add New Task" modal** should match the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/y7bFCUYL5ZHfPeojACBXg2/Challenges-%7C-JSL?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=NNqgDPlU1PNLLh8i-0), including mobile-responsive behavior.
- Ensure that the modal and task board are **fully responsive** and function properly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- The "Add Task" button should **transform** appropriately on mobile devices to match the Figma design.

## Code Structure & Maintainability

- **Modularize your JavaScript code**: Break your code into separate modules, each handling a **single responsibility** (e.g., local storage handling, task rendering, modal management).
- Use **descriptive variable and function names** to ensure the code is clear and easy to maintain.
- Include **JSDoc comments** for every major function and module to describe their functionality, parameters, and return values.

## Expected Outcome

A fully functional task management system where tasks are dynamically loaded from **local storage**, tasks can be **added through a modal**, and the application **remains consistent** after refreshing the page. The code will be modular, well-documented, and easy to maintain, following best practices for JavaScript development.
